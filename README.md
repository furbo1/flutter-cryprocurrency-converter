# Bitcoin Ticker App ðŸ¤‘

Welcome to my Bitcoin Ticker App project! This application serves as a convenient tool for tracking cryptocurrency prices, specifically tailored for those invested in the dynamic world of Bitcoin. Through the development process, I gained hands-on experience with both Cupertino and Material Design Widgets, integrating them seamlessly to offer a responsive and platform-adaptive user interface.

## Project Overview

In this project, I constructed a cryptocurrency price tracker using www.coinapi.io , enabling users to stay updated with Bitcoin prices on the go. This application is not only a showcase of practical Flutter development skills but also an exploration of adapting UI components to fit the aesthetics and usability norms of different operating systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have Flutter installed on your system. For guidance on setting up Flutter, refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Clone the Project

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/bitcoin-ticker.git
cd bitcoin-ticker-flutter
```

### Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```
This command compiles the app and launches it on a connected device or emulator.

##Key Learnings

*Dropdown Menus: Mastered integrating DropdownButton, a Material Design widget, to allow users to select from different cryptocurrencies.
*Looping in Dart: Enhanced my understanding of iterating over data structures using for and for-in loops to dynamically populate UI components.
*Platform-Specific UI: Learned to use Cupertino widgets alongside Material Design widgets to create a UI that adapts to the platform it's running on, ensuring a native look and feel on both iOS and Android.
*Platform Detection: Implemented platform detection logic to customize the app's interface according to the operating system, enhancing the user experience.
